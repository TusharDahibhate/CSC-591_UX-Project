## Description

Secmation has developed a Manufacturing Execution System called SAMM to manage, monitor, and execute tasks on different machines in a seamless manner. As a part of the UX course, our main focus was to design a User Interface for monitoring tasks, machines, and capture the security-related aspects in a user-friendly manner. The goal was to help the operators use machines without any struggle.
